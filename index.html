        Chadwick Boseman was an American actor known for his portrayals of
        real-life historical figures such as Jackie Robinson in 42, James Brown

        his portrayal of the superhero Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic
        Universe films, including Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther,
        Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame.

        Boseman was born and raised in Anderson, South Carolina, and attended
        college at Howard University in Washington, D.C. He began his career as
        a writer and director, and in 2003 he landed his first television role
        in an episode of Third Watch. He went on to appear in a number of
        television shows and films, including Law & Order, ER, and The Express:
        The Ernie Davis Story.

        Boseman's breakout role came in 2013 when he was cast as Jackie Robinson
        in the biographical film 42. He received critical acclaim for his
        performance, and the film was a commercial success. Boseman went on to
        star in a number of other biographical films, including Get on Up,

        In 2016, Boseman was cast as T'Challa, the Black Panther, in Captain
        America: Civil War. The character was well-received by audiences and
        critics, and Boseman reprised the role in three more films. Black
        Panther was a critical and commercial success, and Boseman's performance
        was widely praised. He went on to appear in Avengers: Infinity War and
        Avengers: Endgame, which were also critical and commercial successes.
